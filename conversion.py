#Talking/ Commenting through my process: 
# I am firstly delcaring variables of different data types below:
var1 = int(99.23)
var2 = float(23)
var3 = str(150)
var4 = int("100")

# I then print what I get once I change the variable type to check that I have converted data type correctly 
print(var1) #99 (after converting 99.23 into an integer)
print (var2) #23.0 (after converting 23 into a float)
print(var3) #"150"(after converting 150 into a string)
print(var4) # 100 (after converting "100" string to an integer)

# Then I get python to print out a command, telling me what the new data type of the variables i've printed out are:
print("Types:")
print(type(num1))
print(type(num2))
print(type(num3))
print(type(string1))
